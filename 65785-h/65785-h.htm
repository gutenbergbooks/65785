</div>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> is nothing if not omniscient; and, like Othello,
his occupation’s gone if he be not the first to
spread the news and carry the fiery cross of
scandal to the front. For the Newsmonger does
not care to carry good news so much as bad; the
latter having a dash of spice in it, wanting to
the former—as red pepper titillates the palate
more than does either honey or sugar. The Newsmonger
knows everything, and foresees as much
as he knows. When A’s sudden bankruptcy
takes the world in general by surprise, he, on
the contrary, is not the least astonished. He
knew it weeks ago. He can put in black and
white the exact sum for which he has failed—for
all that the books are still in the safe, and the
accountant has not begun to score up the items;
and he knows who is the largest creditor, who
the most implacable, and what is the bad debt
which has caused all the mischief. He takes
care, however, not to state plainly all these things.
He only says he knows; and people are found
to believe him. When Mrs B runs off with Mr
C, and thus exposes the hollowness of the
domestic happiness of the B’s, which was considered
so complete; he knew all about that, too,
long before it happened. Indeed, he had warned
C that he was going too far, and that harm would
come of it, Mrs B being but a feather-head at the
best; and he had even thrown out friendly hints
to B, advising him to be a little more strict in
his guard and watchful in his care. But no man
is so deaf as he who will not hear, nor so blind
as he who will not see; and B was bent on his
own destruction, and would not be enlightened.
Whom the gods would destroy, they first madden;
and what is the use of hammering your head
against a stone wall? Again, when Edwin and
Angelina come to an abrupt rupture, and the
engagement which promised so well and looked
so satisfactory all round, is broken off in a
hurry, to the open-mouthed amazement of
society—though the cause remains a profound
mystery to all the rest, Our Newsmonger winks
knowingly when he gives you the story, and
tells you that he is in the confidence of both
parties, and understands the whole thing from
end to end. How should he not, when he
has been consulted from the beginning, and
himself advised the rupture as the only thing
left to be done? Whatever happens, he has been
at the back of it; and no event takes place of
which he has not been cognisant or ever it was
made manifest to the crass public. This must
needs be, seeing that he is the general adviser
of the whole world, and taken into every one’s
confidence, from the laying of the egg to the
strutting forth of the full-plumaged fowl.</p>

<p>It is the same thing with political matters. To
hear him, you would say Our Newsmonger had
a telephonic communication with all the courts
in Europe; and that he and the secret things
of the future lay together on the knees of the
gods. He has the insight of Tiresias, and the
prophetic vision of Cassandra. Russia cannot
make a spring of which he had not seen the
secret silent combining. France cannot pass a law
which is not the logical outcome of the position
he explained not so long ago. That insurrection
at the back of unpronounceable mountains among
tribes of whom no one but a few nomadic experts
know, or the existence, or the aims, or the wrongs—did
he not foretell it?—that tightening of the
Bismarckian gag—did he not foretell that too?
No one remembers that he did foretell any one
of these things; but if he says so? As it is impossible
to doubt the word of a man who is also a
gentleman, and whom you ask to dinner four
times in the year, we must take Our Newsmonger
at his own showing, and assume that we have been
deaf, not that he was—mistaken. When Major
Corkscrew, however, twits him with that drop
made in Panslavonic Unifieds, of which Our
Newsmonger was a rather large holder, and asks
him, why, knowing the turn things were sure to
take, he did not go in for the fall, and sell out
while stock was steady?—he puts on a grave air
and says he thinks confidential communications
ought to be sacred, and that it would be highly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">{354}</span>
dishonourable on his part were he to use his
private information for his own private gain.
Whereupon Major Corkscrew rubs up his three
hairs and a quarter, and whistles, in that low way
he has. ‘Only give <i>me</i> the chance, that’s all!’
he says, swelling out his chest. ‘If I knew a
quarter as much as you say you do, my good
friend, I would be a rich man before the year was
out. Hang me else!’</p>

<p>And after all, it was strange, was it not? that,
knowing of this coming insurrection at the back
of the unpronounceable mountains, Our Newsmonger
should have gone in for a rise, when
Panslavonic Unifieds were so sure to come down
with a rattling run, as soon as the first gun was
fired by the obscure tribes aforesaid? Those who
like it can accept the explanation as gospel truth
and sure; but a healthy scepticism is not a bad
state of mind for the more wary to cultivate, and
the doctrine of infallibility is not so fashionable
as it used to be.</p>

<p>On all the undiscovered mysteries of history and
the undisclosed secrets of literature, Our Newsmonger
has opinions as decided as on other things.
Sometimes he follows one authority out of many—as
when he supports himself on the dictum
of Voltaire, and maintains that the Man in the
Iron Mask was the twin-brother of Louis XIV.,
and that all other hypotheses do not hold water.
And sometimes he asserts, but forgets to prove—as
when he ascribes the <i>Letters of Junius</i> to Lord
George Sackville, and scouts the reasoning of
experts which gives them to Sir Philip Francis.
In modern times, he knows all the ‘ghosts,’ and
spots all the Anons. He does not give their
names, because that would be dishonourable, you
know, as he has been told by the people themselves
in confidence, and he must not betray his
trust. He would give them if he chose; but he
must not; and you must be content with this
vague flash of a dim light before your eyes. If
you are not, you will have nothing better; for
Our Newsmonger is above all a man of honour
where undiscovered secrets are concerned. When
they are made public, then he can say that he
knew them all along—thus betraying no one.</p>

<p>This reticence in large matters where no one
would be hurt by free speech, unfortunately
does not influence Our Newsmonger in those small
things of private life which do a great deal of
harm and cause much personal pain when blurted
abroad. It would not signify more than the
buzz of a fly on the window-pane if the unknown
inhabitants of an obscure village in the west of
England were told the name of the person who
wrote <i>Democracy</i>, for instance; or that of the
Russian woman of high rank who played ‘La
Dame aux Camellias’ in a mask; if they had the
true key to one of Daudet’s novels, or could dot
the i’s of all the ‘Queer Stories’ in <i>Truth</i>. No
one would be substantially the wiser for knowing
that the hero of the midnight escapade recorded
in the one was the Duke of Sandwich or the
Prince of Borrioboolagha. Nor would it be of
the least consequence to any one whatever,
inhabiting the pretty district of Pedlington-in-the-Mud,
if the name of the young gentleman
who fell among thieves when he went to the
Jews, and had to pay eighty per cent. for a
loan which included bad champagne and worse
pictures, were George Silliman or Harry Prettyman.
But things are different when it is said
of Mrs Smith—the wife of the rector who rules
over things spiritual, and directs things temporal
too, in Pedlington-in-the-Mud—that she dyes her
hair and corks her eyebrows; of Miss Lucy, the
daughter of the Squire, that she paints her face
and flirts with the footman; and of Major Corkscrew,
that he tipples—and his housekeeper knows
it. Such things as these carried from house to
house as so many black beetles to infest the
kitchen—so many moths to eat into the ermine—do
an incalculable amount of damage. But Our
Newsmonger, who would not sell a hundred
pounds-worth of stock on information received,
nor tell the name of Louis Napoleon’s private
counsellor, has no scruple in letting fly all these
dingy little sparrows to peck at the golden grain
of local repute, and to do irremediable harm to
all concerned.</p>

<p>There is nothing that does not pass through
the alembic of the Newsmonger. He knows the
exact spot in the house where each man keeps
his skeleton, and he can pitch the precise note
struck when the bones rattle in the wind and
the poor possessor turns pale at the sound. Mrs
Screwer starves her servants; but then Mr
Screwer gambles, and the family funds are
always in a state of fluctuation which makes
things too uncertain to be counted on. Mrs
Towhead scolds her household till she maddens
the maids and dazes the men, so that they do
not know which end stands uppermost. But
then Mr Towhead sends the poor woman mad
herself by his open goings-on with that little
minx round the corner. And if Mrs Towhead
takes it out in a general conflagration, is it to
be wondered at, seeing the provocation she has?
The Spendthrifts are out at elbows, and no one
can get paid, for all they gave that magnificent
ball last week on the coming of age of young
Hopeful, who inherits more debts than rents, and
has more holes in his purse than coin to stop them
with. Miss Hangonhand is taken to Paris for
the chance of a husband, those in London proving
shy and the supply not equalling the demand;
and Dr Leech’s bill was exorbitant, and a lawsuit
was threatened if he would not abate just one
half. And then that Mr Fieri Facias—have you
not heard that he has been dealing with his
clients’ securities, and that if matters were looked
into he would be now standing in the dock of
the Old Bailey? I assure you they say so; and
for my part I always believe that where there is
much smoke there must be some fire! The Bank,
too, is shaky; and you who are a shareholder,
and you who are a depositor, had both better
get out of it without a day’s delay.</p>

<p>All these things, and more, Our Newsmonger
will say with a glib tongue and a light heart;
and whether what he says has a grain of truth,
or is pure unmixed and unmitigated falsehood,
troubles him no more than if the wind blows
from the south-west or the south-south-west with
a point to spare. He can retail a bit of gossip
which will make his visit pass easily and keep
the conversation from lagging; and which also
will put him into the position of one who knows,
and thus place him on rising ground while his
friends are only in the shallows. And what
matters it if, for this miserable little gain, he
obscures a reputation, breaks a heart, destroys a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">{355}</span>
life? He has had his pleasure, which was to
appear wiser than the rest; and if others have
to pay the bill, the loss is theirs, not his!</p>

<p>A Newsmonger of this kind is the very pest
of the neighbourhood where he may have pitched
his tent. A fox with silent feet and cruel flair
prowling about the henroost where the nestling
chickens lie—a viewless wind laden with poison-germs,
and bringing death wherever it blows—a
lurking snake, hidden in the long grass and discovered
only when it has stung—these and any
other similes that can be gathered, expressive of
silent secret wrong-doing to innocent things, may
be taken as the signs of the Newsmonger in
small places where propinquity places reputations
at the mercy of all who choose to attack them.
From such, may the good grace of fortune and
the honest tongues of the sturdy and the upright
deliver us!—for if all the evil that is said of men
were tracked to its source, that source would be
found to lie, not in fact, but in the fertile imagination
of the Newsmonger. After all, we know
nothing better than each other. And as we have
to live in human communion, it is as well to live
in peace and harmony, and in seeing the best,
and not the worst. The Newsmonger thinks
differently. But then those who are wise discard
him as a nuisance and a mischief-maker; and
their way in life is all the more peaceful in
consequence.</p>

<p class="ph3">BY CHARLES GIBBON.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.—THE CONJURER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Beecham</span> returned.</p>

<p>‘The young people are crowding in now; and
Mrs Joy and the schoolmistress with some of their
friends are trying to place them comfortably, so
that the smallest may have the front benches.
Come along and help them.’</p>

<p>The long narrow hall was already well filled,
the faces of the children shining with the combined
effect of recent scrubbing and excitement.
Some of the youngest faces wore a half-frightened
expression, for the only magician they knew about
was the wicked one in the story of Aladdin, and
they did not know what the magician they were
to see to-night might do to them. But others
had seen this conjurer performing on the village
green in open daylight on fair-days, and were
able to reassure the timid ones, whilst regaling
them in loud whispers with exaggerated accounts
of the wonderful things he had done.</p>

<p>In the background were parents, on whose
heavy and usually expressionless faces a degree
of curiosity was indicated by open mouths and
eyes staring at the still unoccupied platform on
which the performance was to take place. Along
the side, near the front, was a row of chairs
occupied by Mrs Joy and her friends, who were
presently joined by Mr Beecham and Wrentham,
and later by Dr Joy. One of Mr Beecham’s ideas
was not to overawe the children by the presence
of too many of the ‘gentry;’ consequently, he
only invited those who were to help him in
making his young guests comfortable.</p>

<p>The whispering ceased suddenly on the appearance
of the conjurer.</p>

<p>Wrentham leaned carelessly back on his chair,
so that Mrs Joy’s bonnet hid his face from Mr
Tuppit.</p>

<p>The latter looked quite smart in his well-brushed
black frock-coat, his white collar, his
lavender-coloured tie, secured in a large brass
ring with a glass diamond in the centre, which
glistened in the lamp-light and at once attracted
the children’s eyes. The professor of wonders
had a long solemn face, and black hair brushed
close to his head, where it stuck as if pasted on
with oil. His voice had a pleasant ring, and he
began by merrily informing his audience that
he intended to explain to them how all his
tricks were done. Every boy and girl who
watched him attentively would be able—with
a little practice, of course—to do everything he
did. This was delightful information, and secured
immediate attention. But it was a little dashed
by the intimation that they would first have to
learn how to spell the mystic word ‘Abracadabra.’
However, he would teach them how to do that
too; and he pinned on the wall a scroll bearing
the word in large red letters. This was a clever
dodge to divert too quick eyes from his sleight
of hand.</p>

<p>Then, chattering all the time, he began his
tricks. Pennies were transformed into half-crowns
and back to the poorer metal, much to
the regret of the grinning yokels—one of them
denounced it as ‘a mortal shame;’ handkerchiefs
were torn into shreds and returned to their
owners neatly folded and uninjured; a pigeon
was placed under a cap, and when the cap was
lifted there was a glass of water in its stead;
cards seemed to obey the conjurer like living
things—and so on through the usual range of
legerdemain.</p>

<p>The great feat of the evening was the last.
Mr Tuppit advancing with a polite bow—an
excessively polite bow—begged Mr Wrentham to
be so good as to trust him for a few minutes
with his hat, which should be returned uninjured.
Wrentham stared at the man, as if privately
confounding his impudence, and complied with
the request. Another polite bow and a smile,
and the conjurer returned to his rostrum. The
glossy hat was placed on the table: flour, water,
raisins, and all the ingredients for a plum-pudding
were poured into it amidst the laughter and
excited exclamations of the youngsters, who could
scarcely retain their seats. The whole was stirred
with the magic rod, then covered with a cloth,
and when that was removed, there arose a column
of steam as from a caldron. A waiter brought
a huge plate, and the conjurer tumbled out on
it a piping hot plum-pudding from the hat. The
wonder was not over yet. The pudding was
quickly cut into hunks, and two waiters were
employed to serve it to the astounded audience.
But how that pudding came to suffice for the
supply of all those young folk and their parents
was a mystery which only the conjurer, Mr
Beecham, and the hotel cook could properly
explain.</p>

<p>The hat was restored to its owner in perfect
condition. Wrentham said ‘Thank you,’ and again
stared at the man, who again bowed politely,
and retired after saying good-night to the children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">{356}</span>
whose cheers were not stifled even by mouthfuls
of plum-pudding.</p>

<p>‘There is another of my sources of happiness,’
said Mr Beecham as Wrentham was going away;
‘doing something to make others happy.’</p>

<p>Wrentham had not gained the particular information
he had been seeking as to Beecham’s
antecedents, but he had learned several things.</p>

<p>‘Bob is becoming troublesome. I must arrange
with him either to sail in the same boat or not
to run foul of me in this way.’</p>

<p>His report to Mr Hadleigh was brief and
decisive. ‘I can make nothing of Beecham except
that he is a harmless, good-natured chap, who
likes to spend his money in standing treat to
all the youngsters in the parish. There is no
sham about his philanthropy either: never a bit
of fuss. Take last night, for instance. Nobody
knew anything about it barring those who were
invited. I can’t make him out; but Miss Heathcote
may be able to help you. He corresponds with
her.’</p>

<p>‘Corresponds with her?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I saw a letter addressed to her on his
desk. They seem to be great chums, too, as I
hear—and he is not too old to be a lover.’</p>

<p>‘That is curious,’ said Mr Hadleigh thoughtfully,
but not heeding the jest with which
Wrentham concluded his remarks.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.—THE ENTHUSIAST.</h3>

<p>Philip was a little bothered by what Madge had
told him. In honest dealing he was unable to
comprehend how man or woman could have any
knowledge or design which might not be communicated
to the person who was nearest in
affection to him or her. He took for granted
that he must stand nearest in affection to Madge.
If the knowledge or design was not intended to
hurt anybody, why should there be any mystery
about it? The more light that shone upon one’s
work, the better it would be done. Those who
by choice worked in the dark must be trying to
deceive somebody—maybe themselves. He had
as little liking for mysteries as Aunt Hessy
herself, because he could not see the use of
them.</p>

<p>Had he consulted his brother Coutts on this
subject, he would have learned from that City
philosopher that the business of every man was
to cheat—well, if the sound was more pleasing,
overreach—every other man. Only a fool would
make plain to others what he was going to do
and how he meant to do it—and the fool paid
the penalty of his folly by going promptly to the
wall. He would have learned that in the race
for Fortune there are many runners who want
to be first to reach the winning-post. Therefore,
it behoved every racer to keep the qualities of
his horse dark, and to keep his fellows ignorant
of the turns on the course where he purposed to
put on an extra spurt and outwit them.</p>

<p>‘A clever lie,’ Coutts would have said with
his cynical smile, ‘often saves much trouble, and
wins the game. Most of the losers grin and
bear, and whilst congratulating the winner, laugh
at the “truthful James” who grumbles that he
has lost because he did not understand or
could not submit to the recognised rules of the
course.’</p>

<p>‘But how can a lie be necessary?’ Philip would
have asked—‘how can it be useful unless you
mean to cheat?’</p>

<p>That was his great stumbling-block: he could
not understand the use of a lie, any more than
he could understand a captain in a fog running
his vessel straight ahead without regard to compass
or charts.</p>

<p>Coutts would regard him pityingly, and answer
with the calmness of one whose principles are
founded upon established law:</p>

<p>‘Why I tell a lie is because I wish to gain an
advantage over somebody. If gaining this advantage
be cheating, then I must cheat, because
everybody else is doing the same thing; or I
must submit to be cheated. However, in the
City it is vulgar to talk about cheating and lies
in connection with respectable business transactions.
When we profit by the ignorance of others,
we call it rules of trade, custom, and may
occasionally go so far as to speak of sharp practice;
but so long as a man keeps on the right side of
the law, we never use such rude language as you
do. When he gets to the wrong side of the law,
however—that is, when he is found out—we are
down upon him as heavily as you like. You had
better not meddle with business, Philip, for you
will be fleeced as easily as a sick sheep.’</p>

<p>Philip turned away in disgust from the ethics
of selfishness as expounded by his brother, and
refused to believe that the primary rule for
success in business was to do the best for yourself
no matter what others lose, or that any enterprise
of moment had ever been carried to a successful
issue under the guidance of such a theory. People
might hold their tongues when silence meant no
harm to any one and possible good to somebody.
That was right, and that was what Madge was
doing.</p>

<p>So, after the first sensation of bother—for it
was not displeasure or suspicion of any kind:
only a mixed feeling of regret and astonishment
that there could be, even for a brief period, a
thought which they might not both possess—he
proceeded with the work in hand. She gave him
what is most precious to the enthusiast, sympathy
and faith in his visions.</p>

<p>‘People of experience,’ he told her, ‘say that
I am aiming at an ideal condition of men, which
is pretty as an ideal, and absolutely impracticable
until human nature has so altered that all men
are honest. Besides, they say, I am really
striving after community of interest, which has
been tried before and failed. Robert Owen tried
it long ago—Hawthorne and his friends tried it—and
failed. I answer, that although my object is
the same as theirs, my way of reaching it is
different. It is certainly community of interest
that I seek to establish, but under this condition—that
the most industrious and most gifted shall
take their proper places and reap their due
reward. Every man is to stand upon his own
merits: if fortune be his aim, let him win it by
hard work of hand and brain. The man who
works hardest will get most, and he who works
least will get least. I think that is perfectly simple,
and easily understood by any man or woman who
is willing to work. There are to be no drones,
as I have said, to hamper the progress of the
workers.’</p>

<p>Madge could see it all, and the scheme was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">{357}</span>
noble one in her eyes, which ought to be workable—if
they could only get rid of the drones. But
that ‘if’ introduced Philip to his troubles.</p>

<p>The question as to the price of the land Philip
desired to purchase had been settled with amazing
promptitude after he had, in the rough but
emphatic phrase, ‘put his foot down.’ Wrentham
came to him with looks of triumph and the exclamation,
‘See the conquering hero comes.’ He
was under the impression that he had done a good
stroke of business.</p>

<p>‘I treated the greedy beggars to what I call
the don’t-care-a-brass-farthing style. I was only
an agent, and my principal said take it or leave it.
I didn’t care which way they decided, at the same
time I had a conviction that they were throwing
away a good offer—cash down. We had some
fencing—I wish you had been there—and at last
they agreed to accept a sum which is only two
hundred beyond what you offered, so I closed the
bargain.’</p>

<p>The difference was not of much consequence;
but for a moment Philip thought it strange
that Wrentham had been able to conclude the
bargain so easily after what he had told him.
The thought, however, passed from his mind
immediately.</p>

<p>Now came the business of starting the work.
Here Caleb Kersey proved useful, not only in
organising the labourers but in dealing with the
mechanics. The difficulty was much the same
with the skilled and unskilled workers—namely,
to enable them to understand that it was better
and honester to employer and employed to be paid
for the work done than for the time spent over
it. Prospective profit did not count for anything
in the minds of most of the men; and the
‘honesty’ that was in the system was regarded
as only another word for extra profit to the
employer.</p>

<p>‘Gammon!’ was the general remark; ‘you
don’t take us in with that chaff. We get so much
an hour, and we mean to have it.’</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, Philip, aided by
Caleb, collected a band of workmen sufficient
for his purpose. For a time all went well.
There were grumblings occasionally; but most
of the men began in a short time to comprehend
how they could improve their own position by
the amount of work produced. But these presently
found themselves hampered and scoffed at
by those whose chief object was to ‘put in time.’
That was the grievance of the real workers: the
grievance of the master, which was not found out
until too late, was that the highest market price
for the best materials was paid for the worst.
The groans became more numerous, and their
outcries louder, as their pay decreased in accordance
with their own decrease of production. But
they said they had ‘put in time,’ and ought to
be paid accordingly. They were completely satisfied
with this argument, which proved to themselves
beyond question that they were being
injured by the man who pretended to be their
friend.</p>

<p>Next the unions spoke, and all the men who
belonged to them were withdrawn. Those who
remained were picketed and boycotted until Philip
took what was considered by his friends another
mad step.</p>

<p>‘Look here, lads, you who are willing to stand
by me—you shall have your home in the works,
and before long we shall have help enough. I am
sorry that we should have had this breakdown;
but I expected something of the sort; and when
I started this scheme of mutual labour for mutual
profit—I ought to say the system of individual
work—I was prepared to encounter much misunderstanding,
but I was inspired by the hope
that in the end I should find real help amongst
the real workers. I am convinced that there are
plenty of men willing to work if they can find it.
Now, why should we not work together? The
principle is a very simple one, and easily understood.
You want to get as much as you can. So
do I. But in getting it, let us try to deserve it by
really earning it. I am trying to earn my share
of the profit that ought to come from the capital
that I hold in trust. At the same time, I will
not allow any man to share with me who says
he cannot produce, but must be paid for the time
he spends inside our gates.’</p>

<p>He was striving to bridge that troublous sea
which lies between capital and labour; and the
great pillars of his bridge were to be productive
labour on the one side and honest buyers on the
other. The men applauded these sentiments,
satisfied that nothing was wanting except the
honest buyers.</p>

<p>‘The real capital of the world is Brains,’ he
said; ‘and to carry out the work which they
devise, the labourer of all degrees is as necessary
as the man with money.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear!’ cried a grim-visaged fellow who
was leaving Philip’s service; ‘and, consequently,
the labourer ought to have share and share alike
in the profits with the money-man.’</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly; and he should, likewise, take
his share in the losses,’ was Philip’s reply; and
he endeavoured to explain his projected scheme
of the regulation of wages by results.</p>

<p>But this was not easy to understand. So long
as he talked of sharing profits, the thing was
clear enough; but when it came to be a question
of also sharing losses, the majority could not see
it. Philip was impatient of their stubborn refusal
to believe in what was so plain and simple to him—that
when a man was paid for what he produced
he would be the gainer or loser according to the
degree of his industry.</p>

<p>However, Philip persevered eagerly with his
scheme, and in his character of honest buyer of
labour he met with many surprises.</p>

<p>Work was scamped: he detected it, and dismissed
the scampers. They went to join the
clamorous crowd of incompetent or lazy workmen
who cry that they only want work, but do not
add to the cry that they want it on their own
terms.</p>

<p>The few real workers who remained became
disheartened because they were so few, and some
of them were frightened by vicious crowds outside.
They had wives and families dependent
on them; but they must obey the inexorable
majority, although in doing so they would have
to accept charity or starvation. They accepted
the charity, and clamoured more loudly than ever
against the tyranny of capital which left them
no other alternative. They loafed about public-houses,
drank beer, discussed their grievances,
whilst their wives went out charing or washing.
And they called themselves over their pewter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">{358}</span>
pots the ill-used, down-trodden people of England!</p>

<p>‘I wish you could get rid of all that sham,’
Philip said, irritated at last with himself as much
as with the men. ‘So long as you are mean
enough to live upon the earnings of your wives,
and what you can borrow or obtain from charity,
and thus supported, refuse to work unless the
terms and the nature of your work be exactly
what you choose to accept, you will never have
the right to call yourselves honest sellers of
labour. I want you to understand me. I say
that if a man wants work, he should be ready to
take up any job that is offered him, whether it
is in his line or not. The nature of the work is
of no consequence so long as a man can do it, for
all work is honourable. What is of consequence
is that a man should be independent of the parish
and the earnings of his wife. I say, here is work;
come and do it: you shall not only have payment
for what you do, but a share in whatever extra
profit it may produce.’</p>

<p>That speech settled the whole affair so far as
the men were concerned. All, except some half-dozen,
left him, and filled their haunts with outcries
against the new monopolist who wanted them
actually to produce so much work for so much
pay. Meanwhile, they got on comfortably enough
with the earnings of their wives and the parish
loaves.</p>

<p>‘God forbid that we should call such creatures
workmen!’ cried Philip in his desperation; ‘but
the country is crowded with them—a disgrace
as much to legislation as to human nature. Let
us see how we can do without them.’</p>

<p>He could have done without them if he had
been allowed a fair chance. But in the first place,
there was Wrentham’s frankly declared objection
that the scheme was all nonsense, and could never
succeed until all men ceased to be greedy or lazy.
And then there was the hardest blow of all to
Philip in the sudden change which came over
Caleb Kersey.</p>

<p>Caleb had entered upon the work with an
enthusiasm as strong as that of Philip himself,
although not so openly expressed. There was a
glow of hopefulness and happiness on his honest
brown face when Philip first laid the plans before
him. Here was the Utopia of which he had
vaguely dreamed: here was the chance for poor
men to take their place in the social sphere
according to their capacities and without regard
to the conditions under which they started. Here
was the chance for every man to have his fair
share of the world’s wealth.</p>

<p>‘I hadn’t the means to work it out as you
have, sir, but my notion has always been something
of the kind that you have got into ship-shape
form. I’ll try to help you.’</p>

<p>And he kept his word. There was no more
earnest worker on Shield’s Land (that was the
name Philip had given to the estate he purchased)
than Caleb. Example, advice, and suggestions of
the practical advantage each man would secure if
he faithfully followed out the rules Philip had
laid down, were given by him to all his fellow-workmen.</p>

<p>Suddenly the enthusiasm disappeared. The
light seemed to fade from his eyes; and Caleb,
who had been the sustaining force of the workers,
became dull and listless.</p>

<p>About Wrentham’s opposition there was a
degree of lightness; as if one should say, ‘Just as
you please, sir; I don’t believe in it, but I am
entirely at your command,’ which did not affect
personal intercourse. With Caleb it was the
reverse, because he felt more deeply. Wrentham
could be at his ease because he regarded the
whole affair as a matter of business out of which
he was to make some money. Caleb thought
only of the possibilities the scheme suggested of
the future of the workman.</p>

<p>Philip had given up all hope of persuading
Wrentham to believe in his theories; but he
could not give up Caleb. So he resolved to speak
to him.</p>

<p>‘What is wrong, Kersey? You have not lost
heart because those fellows have left us?’</p>

<p>‘No, not because of that’ (hesitatingly and
slowly); ‘but they were not so much to blame
in leaving us as you may think, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Well, they did not understand you; and when
they saw things coming in in the raw state at
higher prices than could be got for them when
made up, they didn’t see where the profit you
spoke of was to come from.’</p>

<p>‘Oh——!’ murmured Philip, curiosity aroused,
and the note passing through the stages of surprise
and perplexity to suspicion. ‘Why have you not
told me about this before?’</p>

<p>‘It weren’t my place, sir; Mr Wrentham has
charge of these things.’</p>

<p>A pause, during which Philip tried a paper-knife
on the desk as if it were a rapier. Then:
‘All right; I’ll see about that. But you have
not answered me as to yourself. You are sulking
for some reason. You say it is not the loss of
the men which has put you out of sorts; I know
it is nothing connected with me, or you would
tell me. Then what is it?’</p>

<p>There was no answer; but Caleb bowed his
head and moved as if he wished to go.</p>

<p>‘You have not heard anything about Pansy?’
said Philip suddenly, moved by a good-natured
desire to discover the cause of the man’s depression,
in the hope that he might be able to relieve it.</p>

<p>There was a lurch of the broad shoulders, and
Caleb’s dark eyes flashed like two bull’s-eye
lanterns on his master. ‘No—have you?’</p>

<p>The question was an awkward one for Philip,
remembering what he had thought about the
attentions of his brother to the gardener’s
daughter. He was immediately relieved from his
unpleasant position by Caleb himself. ‘No—I
won’t ask you that, sir; it ’ud be hard lines for
you to have to speak about’——</p>

<p>The rest was a mumble, and Caleb again moved
towards the door. Philip called him back. ‘I
won’t pretend not to know what you mean,
Kersey,’ he said kindly; ‘but if you listen to
what is said by envious wenches or spiteful lads,
you are a confounded fool. Trust her, man;
trust her. That is the way to be worthy of a
worthy woman.’</p>

<p>‘And the way to be fooled by an unworthy
one,’ said Wrentham, who came in as the last
sentence was being uttered. Then seeing Philip’s
frown and Caleb’s scowl, he added apologetically:
‘I beg your pardon. I thought and hope you
were speaking generally, not of any one in
particular.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">{359}</span></p>

<p>‘Come to my chambers this afternoon, Kersey;
I want to speak to you.’</p>

<p>Caleb gave one of his awkward nods and left
the office.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STAINED_GLASS_AS_AN_ACCESSORY_TO">STAINED GLASS AS AN ACCESSORY TO
DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a former paper (September 1879) we briefly
reviewed the growth and progress of the art of
glass-staining and painting, and described the
various processes necessary to its prosecution,
and practised at the present day; and, after
tracing its career in its application to the purposes
of ecclesiastical decoration, hinted at its
capability of adaptation to ornamental requirements
beyond those pertaining to the embellishment
of the sacred edifice. We propose in the
present paper to deal more exhaustively with
this branch of an art, and to endeavour to point
out, as succinctly as possible, the more prominent
and obvious cases where its introduction would be
desirable in secular ornamentation.</p>

<p>Public buildings of course demand the first
attention; and in a country like our own, owing
its prosperity to its commercial enterprise, its
political organisation, and its unequalled system
of municipal government, we have witnessed in
the course of the last few years the commencement,
progress, and completion of costly and
magnificently adorned buildings. Upon these
noble buildings have been lavished the utmost
resources of decorative art; and latterly, stained
glass has formed an important element in the
general scheme of decoration, and it is to its
adaptation to this class of domestic architecture
that we would first draw attention.</p>

<p>One of the first, as it is one of the most natural,
motives prompting the enrichment of the ornamental
accessories of a building, is discovered in
a desire to see perpetuated the memory of its
founder or founders. The most natural expression
of this feeling is, of course, the desire to permanently
retain a record of their features and personal
characteristics in the shape of a pictorial
representation. This desire at first sight seems
to be susceptible of immediate gratification by a
portrait, either on canvas or in marble; but
further consideration will tend towards the
conviction that the use of these media is not
altogether free from objection. Little, perhaps,
can be said against the statue in itself; but
the elaborate and gorgeous decoration of our
more sumptuous buildings is likely to be unpleasantly
marred by the marble pallor of sculpture;
and after all, dignified and stately as are many
of our statuesque memorials, they convey little
more than an idealised impression of the features
of the person commemorated.</p>

<p>The employment of oil portraiture is also open
to certain objections. It must be remembered
that modern decoration means a great deal more
than a mere picking out in gold and colour of the
salient lines of a cornice, or the stencilled powdering
of a conventional pattern over the area of a
wall or a ceiling; it has advanced far beyond
the province of the builder and house-painter, and
demands no inconsiderable proportion of the
genius of the artist. If the decoration of a room
or hall is designed to constitute in itself a complete
work of art, its effect may be grievously
injured by the injudicious introduction of a heavy
gold frame, and colours, which while admirably
accomplishing the purpose of the artist, may in a
great measure interfere with the surrounding harmony
of colour. We have, then, no other place
left but the window, and the problem seems to
be in a fair way towards solution. The perfection
to which the painting of glass has attained leaves
no room for doubt as to the fidelity of the likeness;
but apart from this fact, a far more extensive
recognition of the virtues or services of the
subject of the memorial is to be obtained by various
devices and emblems, appropriate to the
character and life of the person honoured, which
could hardly with propriety be introduced into
an oil picture. One example, recently erected,
may serve to more clearly demonstrate our
meaning. The lately erected town-hall of Lerwick
has been enriched by two windows illustrative
of persons and scenes connected with
some of the primitive traditions of Orkney.
In one window, divided by a central mullion
into twin-lights, is represented the figure of Archbishop
Eystein, one of the earliest of Orcadian
prelates, clad in his archiepiscopal vestments;
while a panel beneath the figure illustrates
his consecration of King Magnus. Side by side
with the figure of the archbishop stands Bishop
William, the founder of the venerable cathedral
of Kirkwall, the formal ceremony itself being
depicted in the panel below. The corresponding
window displays the gigantic form of the Norse
warrior Harald Haarfager, with his landing in
Zetland shown in the lower panel; and Jarl
Rognvald, whose investiture as Earl of Orkney,
870 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, is represented in the panel beneath. In
the ‘tracery’ above the two windows are shown
respectively the Orcadian and Norwegian coats-of-arms.
Now, a combination of such historical
and traditional interest could hardly be otherwise
so successfully treated, while the glowing colours
and fine design materially add to the effect of the
neighbouring beauties of the structure.</p>

<p>There is another consideration not without
importance in connection with the establishment
of a complete scheme of internal decoration.
Light is one of the most important essentials in
a building where exact and extensive business is
transacted, and the presence of large and frequent
windows is a necessity. But how painfully is
the harmony and continuity of the ornament
interrupted by the constant recurrence of these
patches of white light. The eye, in following
the progress of the decorative design, grows weary
of the constant loss and recapture of its thread;
and that which would otherwise have pleased
and charmed by its beauty as a whole, only
perplexes and tires by its division into parts.
Here, then, is called into requisition the art of
the glass-stainer; without any vital diminution
of light, the scheme of colour is no longer disturbed,
a perfect chromatic harmony is established,
and the window serves a double purpose,
by admitting the necessary illumination from
without, and enhancing the beauty of the building
within.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks naturally have reference
to all public buildings of more or less importance,
though we have instanced the town-hall as a
representative building, associated with the more
imposing class of secular edifices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">{360}</span></p>

<p>There is an institution and building, without
the existence of which the writing on subjects of
beauty and art would be a serious waste of time—namely,
the school; and here the introduction
of stained glass may be found of beneficial effect.
It is not to be denied that when the watchful
eye of the master relaxes its vigilance, the youthful
eye will wander too, and the direction of
nearly every eye will be towards the window; and
principals of schools and their subordinates are
fully aware of the fact. They are also aware of
the attractions or distractions presented by the
tempting spectacle of green trees and spreading
meadows in summer; or falling snow and ice-bound
stream in winter, or even at all times
the freedom of the open street; so, to remove
the cause of temptation, the glass is made opaque
by painting it over with a dull white mixture
which effectually conceals the dangerous landscape.
But by the introduction of cathedral glass,
of the simplest patterns and pleasing tints, the
unsightly whitewashed panes would be replaced
by panels of unblemished glass more or less
ornamental, perfectly effectual in their primary
purpose, and at the same time affording some
relief to the eyes from the monotony of the barren
school walls. Tinted glass leaded in various
geometric or flowing patterns might be made
most useful as an excellent substitute for drawing
copies of the elementary stage; the rudiments of
freehand drawing could all be acquired from the
glazed patterns; while, under competent hands,
it could afford most valuable assistance in the
teaching of the laws of the harmony and artistic
contrasting of colours. The trifling initial expense
would be speedily saved, as there would be no
wear and tear of copies; there could be no
<i>measuring</i>, most disastrous to the student; the
copy would be always clean; the colour would be
refreshing to the eye; and much labour would
be saved to the teacher, as he could demonstrate
his teaching to the whole class at once.</p>

<p>Passing from the consideration of public requirements
to those of the private home, the increasing
cultivation and appreciation of the fine arts, and
their application to domestic necessities, are sufficient
encouragement for the advancing of the
claims of stained glass to hold a place in the
general scheme of internal decoration. Of course,
with such diversity as necessarily exists in the
comparative size and extent of family abodes, from
the lordliest mansion, standing in the midst of its
own far-stretching grounds, to the more humble
dwelling, forming a unit among the many that
go to constitute a street, or terrace, or ‘gardens,’
it would be impossible to lay down any precise
suggestions for their ornamentation; but it may
be possible to offer a few general and broadly
elastic ideas, capable of being expanded or contracted
according to the means and wants of
all.</p>

<p>The more pretentious of the mansions of the
nobility and gentry are pretty sure to boast of
at least one fine, large, and imposing window,
affording ample scope for artistic design, and,
whether in the family tracing its pedigree for
centuries, or the <i>nouveau riche</i> who began life
with a struggle, heraldry and its concomitants
seem to be held, more or less, in equal reverence.
It needs little apology, therefore, for suggesting
the blazonry of shield, helmet, crest, mantling,
motto, supporters, and other resources of the
gentle science, as affording a most appropriate
exercise of the glass-stainer’s skill. Making use,
as heraldry does almost exclusively, of the
five most prominent colours, as well as white
and gold, it is admirably adapted for its
reproduction in stained glass, whose exquisite
and transparent tints are seen to fine effect in
heraldic compositions. The matter of expense
is of course an important consideration; but
the treatment of heraldic design can be almost
endlessly modified or elaborated; so that, while
within easy reach of the only moderately affluent,
it may, on the other hand, be raised to such a
height of gorgeous enrichment as to form no
unworthy element in the decoration of a palace.</p>

<p>Nor is a large and finely proportioned window
an absolute necessity. At Rydal Hall, Westmoreland,
the seat of the family of Le Fleming, a
window, the heraldic blazoning of which was
designed by the present writer, consisted merely
of nine upright oblong square panels, each about
two feet high by eighteen inches wide, arranged
three, three, and three; and separated by mullions
and transoms. But this unpromising rigidity
of construction was not only overcome, but made
subservient to the general design, in the following
manner: the arms of the Le Fleming family, in
a shield of nine quarterings, occupied the centre
panel; the quarterings (all divisions of a shield
above two, no matter how many in number, are
called quarters) being those respectively of Le
Fleming, of course in the place of honour, the
dexter chief; and of eight ancestral and collateral
branches of the family; and each of these quarterings,
thus brought together in one shield to form
the perfect ‘achievement of arms’ of the present
representative, was displayed separately on single
shields occupying the eight surrounding panels.</p>

<p>One of the principal documents in the muniment
rooms of the great is the genealogical tree,
duly set forth on musty parchment, in itself a
guarantee of its own antiquity. How admirably
could this be executed in glass! The tree, very
conventionally designed, trained over the whole
surface of the window; the quaintly hung shields
depending from its branches at intervals; the
whole forming an interesting study for antiquary
and genealogist.</p>

<p>But in less ambitious dwellings, stained glass
under various forms may be introduced with
picturesque advantage. It will be acknowledged
that very often, while the front of a house may
look on a well-kept garden, or form part of the
side of a spacious and beautiful square or public
garden, the back may very likely look out on
equally spacious but not equally beautiful or
savoury mews. We know it may be contended
that most back-rooms are bedrooms, and only
used at night. This is true enough. But in
nine cases out of ten, in houses of this class,
there is a staircase window on the first landing,
which, as a rule, looks out on the back,
and is continually calling the attention of those
passing up or down the stairs to the interesting
spectacle of an equine toilet, or some similarly
delectable operation. In this case, a window,
though consisting of only two or three tints of
rolled cathedral glass, and leaded in geometric
or ornamentally flowing lines, would completely
shut out the offensive prospect, while in no way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">{361}</span>
interfering with the necessary lighting of the
stair, nor the opening or shutting of the window-frame;
and the expense would be scarcely if
any more than glazing the sashes with plate-glass,
which, moreover, to look commonly decent,
requires infinitely more frequent cleaning than
the other. This, of course, is almost the simplest
form of treatment; but, according to the length
of purse of the householder, the window may
be more or less ornate in its design. The owner’s
arms, or monogram; floral painted devices, heads,
or figures representing the four seasons, field-sports,
fables, nursery rhymes, and numberless
kindred subjects, are all most appropriate for
delineation, and can be obtained at far less cost
than a doubtful ‘old master,’ or piece of Brummagem
bric-à-brac. A very pretty effect is
obtained at night by filling the sides of a hall-lamp,
or any large conspicuous lamp, with painted
glass of design according to the owner’s fancy;
the old-fashioned clumsy window-blinds are now
frequently superseded by leaded glass screens,
more or less ornamental in their details; and a
great objection to the use of stationary firescreens
hitherto—that while they screen, they also hide
the fire, is removed by the use of screens of glass,
leaded and painted according to the taste and
purse of the buyer.</p>

<p>A great and most important consideration in
the adoption of stained glass is the great variety
of design of which it is susceptible, its range of
artistic production being so extensive and pecuniarily
elastic as to bring it, in one form or another,
within the reach of almost any one occupying
a house; while for cleanliness, durability, and
pleasing effect, whether in the comfortable dwelling
of the thriving tradesman, or adorning the
noblest monuments of private munificence or
national philanthropy, it cannot fail to charm
the eye by its intrinsic beauty; while from the
artist’s practised hand, the jewels of design shed
their lustre on the illuminated walls.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SILAS_MONK">SILAS MONK.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">A TALE OF LONDON OLD CITY.</p>


<h3 title="CHAPTER I.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening—a pitch-dark evening in autumn—a
girl stood at one of the doors in a row of
old houses in the neighbourhood of Crutched
Friars, watching. It was difficult to see many
yards up or down the street, for it was only
lighted by three widely-separated gas-lamps.
Under one of these lamps, at a corner of
the street, there presently appeared a little old
man. He came along slowly, but with a jerky
step like a trot; his head was bent and his
shoulders raised; and he seemed to be rubbing
his hands together cheerfully and hugging himself
from time to time, as though his thoughts were
of a congratulatory nature.</p>

<p>‘Why, grandfather,’ said the girl, descending
into the street as soon as she caught sight of this
figure—‘why, grandfather, how late you are!’</p>

<p>The old man came jogging on, still in his jerky
manner, though faster, at the sound of her voice.
‘Ay, ay!’ said he, shaking out his words, ‘ay,
Rachel, my dear. Always late. Don’t you take
any notice of that. It has been so for years—fifty
years; ay, more than fifty.’</p>

<p>‘Fifty years, grandfather, is a long time,’
remarked the girl as they passed in at the doorway
together, her arms placed protectingly around
him—‘a very long time.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, Rachel; so it is, my dear,’ continued the
old man—‘so it is.’</p>

<p>They entered a small front-room on the ground-floor.
An oil-lamp was burning on the mantel-shelf;
it threw a dim light upon bare and dingy
walls, upon an old deal table, two wooden seats
without backs, and a well-worn leathern armchair
near the fire. Towards this chair the girl now
led the old man as one might lead a child.
Then she began to lay the cloth for the evening
meal. She was a pretty, homely-looking girl of
about eighteen; perhaps a little too pale; and
with eyes, though large and lustrous, somewhat
sad and weary for one so young. But as she
busied herself about the room preparing the
supper, her eyes gradually brightened; and her
face, growing more animated, gained colour, as
though to match the better with her red lips.</p>

<p>The old man, crouching in his armchair before
the fire, took no notice of the girl. His look had
become deeply thoughtful, and he seemed to be
gaining a year in age with every minute that
was passing. The wrinkles increased, and covered
his face like the intersecting lines in cobwebs;
the white eyebrows drooped thick as a fringe,
and meeting over the brow, seemed to be helping
to hide some secret, vaguely expressed in the
small gray eyes. His head was bald, except at the
sides, where scanty locks of snowy white hair
hung about his neck. His long lean fingers were
occasionally spread out upon his knees, though
sometimes the hands grew restless when an
incoherent word escaped his lips. The workings
of the mind indeed were expressed in the
nervously shaped figure as much as in the face.
There were moments when the fingers clawed
and clutched perplexedly; then there came into
the eyes a look of avarice, and the whole form
would seem busily engaged in solving mysterious
problems. There was something almost repellent
in the workings of the mind and body of this
strange old man.</p>

<p>‘Come, grandfather!’ cried the girl, when the
meal was presently spread. ‘The supper is ready
now; and I hope,’ she added, assisting him to a
place at the table—‘I hope you have a better
appetite than usual.’ She spoke in a cheerful
tone, though looking doubtfully the while at
what she had spread on the board. There was
a small piece of cheese, part of a loaf, and a stone
pitcher filled with water—nothing more.</p>

<p>The old man eyed the food keenly. ‘No,
Rachel, no,’ said he; ‘not much appetite, my dear.’</p>

<p>The girl sighed, and took her place opposite to
the old man. ‘I wish,’ said she, ‘that I could
provide something more tempting. You must
be almost famished, after all these hours of work.
But’——</p>

<p>‘Eh?’</p>

<p>‘But we cannot afford it. Can we?’</p>

<p>‘No, my dear, no,’ said the old man, very
shaky in voice; ‘we can hardly afford what we
have.’</p>

<p>Rachel cut her grandfather a slice of bread.</p>

<p>‘Too much, my dear!’ cried he, with a wave of
his hand—‘too much! I’ve no appetite at all.’</p>

<p>The girl divided the bread, a painful look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">{362}</span>
passing over her face. The old man, although
there was a ravenous glance in his eyes strangely
contradictory to his words, began to eat his bread
slowly.</p>

<p>Presently the girl, as though expressing her
thought impulsively, cried: ‘Grandfather! why
are we so poor?’</p>

<p>The old man, who was munching his crust, and
staring abstractedly at the morsel of cheese, looked
up with bewilderment at Rachel.</p>

<p>‘I cannot understand why,’ she continued,
forcing out the words—‘why we are so very,
very poor! I cannot understand why such a
wealthy House as Armytage and Company, where
you have been a clerk for more than fifty years,
should pay you such a small salary.’</p>

<p>‘Small, Rachel?’ asked her grandfather. ‘Fifteen
shillings a week, small?’</p>

<p>‘Well, it does seem so to me,’ the girl replied
in a modest tone.</p>

<p>The old man rubbed his knees nervously and
bent his head, and deep furrows gathered on his
brow. ‘Small, eh? Fifteen shillings a week,
small? Why, Rachel, you talk as though you knew
nothing of this hard-working world. How many
clerks are there in this old city who would go
down on their knees and thank Armytage and
Company for fifteen shillings a week!’</p>

<p>‘Many—very many,’ said the girl sorrowfully.
‘I know that too well. But, grandfather, not one
like you—not one who has served a great House
for more than fifty years.’ She placed her hand
upon the long lean hand of her grandfather.
‘No,’ she continued; ‘not so long as you have.
And,’ she added, ‘surely not so faithfully? The
House of Armytage and Company—I have often
heard you say—place every confidence in you
as their head-cashier. Thousands and thousands
of pounds in the course of the year pass through
your hands: piles of bank-notes, bags and bags
of bright sovereigns, have been paid by you into
the bank’——</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay!’ cried the old man, looking straight
before him, as though at a vision—‘ay, ay!
Bright sovereigns—bags and bags of them—bags
and bags of bright sovereigns!—ah! how they
shine!’ While speaking, he rose from his seat,
rubbing his hands slowly together and hugging
himself, as he had done on his way through the
dark street. He began to pace the room, still
staring at the vision, and muttering: ‘Ay, ay!
how they shine!’</p>

<p>Rachel, watching him with a wondering expression,
said in a low voice, as if speaking aloud
her thoughts rather than addressing her grandfather:
‘What a blessing, if only some of those
shining sovereigns were ours!’</p>

<p>The old man stopped suddenly, staggering as
though he had received a blow, and looked fixedly
at the girl. ‘What can have put that idea into
your head?’</p>

<p>Rachel hung her pretty head as she replied:
‘I want them, grandfather, for you! I want
to see you placed at your ease.’</p>

<p>The old man was silent. His eyes remained
for a moment bent upon the girl’s face; then
he sat down before the fire, and gradually seemed
to fall back into his thoughtful mood, his face
wrinkling more deeply, and the nervous movements
of his hands answering to the constant
plodding of his brain.</p>

<p>Rachel now rose from her seat to clear the table,
moving silently about the room. When she had
finished, she seated herself at her grandfather’s
feet, upon the threadbare patch of carpet before
the hearth, and raising her eyes to his face, she
said: ‘You are not angry with me, grandfather,
for speaking my mind?’</p>

<p>The old man placed his hand tenderly upon the
girl’s head. ‘No, my child—no. There is nothing
in your words to make me angry. But you know
little of the world. You think that we are poor.
You do not know, Rachel, what poverty is. Does,’
he added, with a sudden glance at the girl’s face—‘does
starvation threaten us?’</p>

<p>‘Why, no, grandfather.’</p>

<p>‘Is there any danger,’ he demanded, ‘that we
shall be turned out of our old home?’</p>

<p>‘None, grandfather, that I know of.’</p>

<p>‘Then, my dear, do not let us say that we are
poor. It sounds as though we were in sight of
the workhouse; and that, you know,’ he concluded,
‘that is not true: no, no—not true.’</p>

<p>These words seemed to pacify the girl; and the
two remained silent for a while. Rachel retained
her place at the old man’s feet, her head drooping
on his knee, his hand laid protectingly around her
shoulder.</p>

<p>‘You are tired, Rachel,’ said the old man presently,
noticing that her eyes were half-closed
with sleep. ‘Go, my dear, get to bed. I shall
find my way to my room soon. Don’t mind
me.’</p>

<p>‘Shall you stay up, grandfather?’ asked Rachel,
looking at him with surprise.</p>

<p>‘A little while, Rachel—a little while.’</p>

<p>The girl lingered, and looked reluctantly around
the room. ‘Are you sure you would not like me
to stay with you?’</p>

<p>‘Quite sure, my dear.—Good-night.’</p>

<p>The girl kissed her grandfather. Deep affection
was expressed in her whole demeanour as she bent
over him to say good-night. Then she placed a
very ancient-looking candlestick on the table and
left the room.</p>

<p>When she was gone, a striking change came
over the old man—his face became more animated;
he was younger in look and manner.
Presently, he rose from his seat with surprising
ease for one so old. He stood for a moment in
the middle of the room, leaning forward and
listening, with keenness and cunning expressed in
his eyes. There was not a sound. The street
outside, little frequented even during daylight,
was silent. The old man lit the candle, blew out
the lamp, and went up the old staircase noiselessly.
On one side of the landing above there were two
rooms—the first the bedchamber of the grandfather,
the second that of the girl. Reaching the
landing, he entered his room and closed the door
very cautiously, and always listening.</p>

<p>The room was grotesquely furnished. In one
corner was a large bed, with four black, bare,
oaken posts, with spikes, nearly touching the low
ceiling. The bed-coverings were neat and clean;
and beside the bed was a strip of carpet. But
here all appearance of comfort began and ended.
The contrast gave to the rest of the room a
dreary aspect: the sombre walls, the patched-up
window-panes, the uneven floor, suggested nothing
beyond abject poverty and decay.</p>

<p>Still in a listening attitude, and frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">{363}</span>
glancing keenly about, as though the fear of being
taken by surprise amounted almost to terror, the
old man placed the candle on the drawers, and
taking a bunch of keys from his pocket, unlocked
a cupboard in the wall and took out sundry
articles. Firstly, a thick long overcoat, into
which he disappeared, leaving only his head
visible; secondly, a large fur-cap, which he drew
down to his eyebrows and over his ears; thirdly,
he brought forth a dark-lantern; this he carefully
trimmed, lighted, and closed. These strange proceedings
completed, he threw the bedclothes, with
evident intention, into some disorder, put out the
candle, and left the room. For a moment he
stood on the landing, listening at his grand-daughter’s
half-open door. It was dark within
her room, and a soft regular breathing, as from
one who sleeps, fell upon the old man’s ear.
Apparently satisfied, he nodded his head slowly;
and then he began to descend the dark staircase.
Step by step he crept down, casting at intervals
a trembling ray of light before him from
the lantern which he held in his shaky hand.
When he reached the passage, he opened the
front-door and went into the night, closing the
portal without a sound. As he had come, when
his grand-daughter stood waiting for him on the
doorstep, so he went, hugging himself, and moving
with a jerky trot along the silent, lonely way,
under the dim lamps fixed in the walls over his
head. So he went, like a mysterious, restless
shadow. Where? The old city clocks are striking
midnight; they awaken echoes in tranquil
courts and alleys; their droning tones die out,
and break forth again upon the night, as though
demanding in their deep monotonous voices—‘Where?’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Rachel arose at an early hour on the
following morning, her pretty face expressed no
surprise when she found that her grandfather was
up and away without awakening her. The same
thing had occurred so often in her young life, that
although she felt regret at not seeing him at the
breakfast-table, she took for granted that the
important affairs of the great firm of Armytage
and Company had called him away to the
counting-house; so she made herself as happy
and contented as might be under the circumstances.
She lit the fire, breakfasted, and then
busied herself about the old house until towards
noon, when she sat down by the window in the
sitting-room with her work, looking out upon
the dismal row. A dismal place, even upon a
bright autumn morning. The row faced a plot
of waste ground. On this plot there had once
stood, in all probability, a row of houses similar
to the row in which Rachel and her grandfather
lived; but nothing now remained except the
foundations of houses, filled with rubbish of every
description in the midst of broken bricks. In
the centre of the place there was planted a wooden
beam with a crossbar, like a gibbet, from which
was suspended a lantern, broken and covered
with dust. Whether this lantern had ever been
lighted, may be doubtful; but that some one
had placed it there with the intention of warning
people who had some regard for their shins
against trespassing after dark, and had afterwards
forgotten to light it, is the probable explanation
of the matter. Be this as it may, Rachel sat
regarding this scarecrow-looking lamp dreamily,
as she had often done, without being conscious that
it was there, with the piles of dark houses in the
background, when the figure and, more especially,
the handsome face of a young man on the opposite
side of the street, somehow got in front of the
lantern and blotted it out.</p>

<p>As Rachel’s eyes met the eyes of the young
man, a smile of recognition crossed the girl’s face.
She threw open the window. ‘Good-morning, Mr
Tiltcroft.’</p>

<p>To which the young man answered, as he
stepped across the road: ‘Good-morning, Miss
Rachel.’</p>

<p>‘Have you come from the counting-house?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I’m on my “rounds,” you know, as
usual,’ replied the young man; ‘and happening
by mere accident to be passing this way on matters
of business for Armytage and Company, I thought
it would scarcely be polite to go by the house
of Silas Monk without inquiring after the health
of Miss Monk, his grand-daughter.’</p>

<p>‘You are very kind. Won’t you come in?’</p>

<p>The young man willingly assented. The girl
opened the front-door, and they went in together,
and sat down side by side near the fire.</p>

<p>‘You have always been such a kind friend to
my grandfather and to me, Walter,’ said the girl,
‘that although it may seem strange to you that
I should put the question I am going to ask,
still I am sure you will believe I have a
good reason for doing so. Tell me, if you
can, why it is that my grandfather, who has
served the House of Armytage and Company so
many years—so many, many years,’ she repeated
with emphasis, ‘and so faithfully too, should
receive so paltry a salary? Can you explain it?’</p>

<p>The young man looked up with some surprise
expressed in his frank eyes. ‘Paltry, Rachel?’
asked he. ‘I call it princely!’</p>

<p>A look of disappointment, even of regret, came
into the girl’s face. ‘That is what grandfather
says. He talks as though he thought it princely
too. He always reminds me, when I mention
the subject, that there are hundreds of poor clerks
in this old city of London who would be only
too glad if they could make sure of a like
remuneration.’</p>

<p>‘So <i>I</i> should think,’ cried the young man,
laughing. ‘Why, Rachel, if I had a salary half
as large as your grandfather, I’d ask you to
marry me to-morrow!’</p>

<p>‘Be serious, please.’</p>

<p>‘So I am serious! What astonishes me is, that
Silas Monk, with the fine salary—in my opinion,
very fine salary—which he draws from Armytage
and Company, should live in a back street like
this. It’s downright incomprehensible!’</p>

<p>‘What can you mean?’ The girl uttered the
words in a hurried voice, as though a sudden
thought had crossed her mind. She placed her
hand upon Walter’s arm and said: ‘Don’t
speak!’</p>

<p>What troubled her was the discovery that her
grandfather had deceived her. There was no
truth in what he had led her to believe about
their intense poverty. They were perhaps rich,
and had been for years, while she had remained
in ignorance of the fact. What was his object
in concealing this from her? She could not doubt
that it was a good one. He knew the world and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">{364}</span>
all the horrors of poverty; how often he had
spoken of that! He wished to leave her in a
position of independence; and doubtless he had
the intention of telling her this secret as an
agreeable surprise.</p>

<p>‘Walter,’ said she, looking up into the youth’s
face after this pause, ‘you must think me strangely
discontented to speak as I have just done of
Armytage and Company. I value my grandfather’s
services to the firm perhaps far too high.
But he was a clerk in the House before the
oldest living partner was born. No salary, not
even the offer of a share in the business, would
seem to me more than he merits.’</p>

<p>‘Exactly what we all say in the office,’ replied
Walter. ‘But then, you know, five hundred a
year is not so bad. I shall think myself lucky
if I ever get within two hundred of it—I shall
indeed.’</p>

<p>Could she be dreaming? Five hundred pounds
a year! Ever since her earliest childhood, she
had implicitly believed that fifteen shillings a
week was the amount her grandfather earned—not
a farthing more.</p>

<p>Rachel rose from her seat and went to the
window. Her perplexity was too great to allow
her, without betraying it, to utter a word. Yet
she wished to speak; she wanted to question
Walter in a hundred ways. There were perhaps
other mysteries—at least so she began to think—which
he might assist her to solve. Calming
herself as best she could, she turned to him, and
said: ‘Can you stay a moment longer? There is
something I should like to know about my grandfather.’</p>

<p>‘There are many things, Rachel, that I should
like to know,’ said the young man, laughing.
‘Many things that most of us at the office would
like to know about the dear, eccentric, old fellow!—Well,
Rachel, what is it?’</p>

<p>The girl, hesitating a moment, replied: ‘One
thing puzzles me greatly—why is grandfather
kept so very late every evening at the office?’</p>

<p>Walter Tiltcroft looked round quickly. ‘What
do you call late, Rachel?’</p>

<p>‘Ten o’clock, eleven, sometimes midnight.’</p>

<p>‘No one remains after six.’</p>

<p>‘No one?’ asked the girl—‘not even grandfather?’</p>

<p>‘That,’ replied the young man, ‘no one knows.
He is always the last. He locks up the place.
He is First Lord of the Treasury. He looks after
the cash: he stays to see that all is safe in
the strong-room. That has been his office for
years. He is, some of them think, getting too
old for the post. But that’s a matter for the partners
to settle. He is still hale and hearty. There
is, therefore, no reason why he should be superseded—at
least, none that I can see.’</p>

<p>‘But surely, Walter, the mere matter of locking
up the strong-room cannot occupy grandfather
from six o’clock until even ten, much, less until
midnight.’</p>

<p>‘That’s the mystery,’ said the young man
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Rachel clasped her hands and turned her pale
face towards Walter. ‘What you tell me, makes
me very anxious,’ said she. ‘Indeed, I know not
why, but I begin to be seriously alarmed. What
can all this mean?’</p>

<p>‘What, indeed? That’s the mystery,’ repeated
the young man, in a still more meditative
tone.</p>

<p>‘Then again, Walter, I cannot understand why
grandfather leaves home for the counting-house,
as he tells me, at five o’clock in the morning.
Can that be necessary?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no! The hours are from nine till
six,’ cried Walter. ‘But at what hour Silas
Monk arrives, no one knows, or ever did know.
We always find him seated at his desk in the
morning when we come, just as we leave him
there when we go in the evening.—Do you know,
Rachel,’ added Walter, ‘if I was ignorant of the
fact that he had his home and this little housekeeper,
I should be disposed to agree with the
fellows at the office who declare Silas Monk
haunts the counting-house all night long.’</p>

<p>Rachel started. These words, uttered by the
young man half in jest, brought thoughts into
the girl’s head which had never entered there
before.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, Rachel,’ said Walter. ‘Armytage and
Company will be wondering what has become
of me.’</p>

<p>The lovers went together to the front-door,
where Walter hastily took his leave. He looked
back, however, more than once, as he went down
the street, and saw Rachel standing on the
doorstep watching him. So, when he reached
the corner, he waved his hand to her, and then
plunged into the busy thoroughfare.</p>

</div>
<p class="ph3">BY A SHETLANDER.</p>


<h3 title="PART I.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are but two species of seal permanently
resident on our coasts—the Common Seal (<i>Phoca
vitulina</i>) and the Great Seal (<i>Phoca barbata</i>). The
Greenland seal has occasionally been seen in Shetland,
and even shot; but these were only stragglers,
not improbably floated far southward on small
icebergs or floes of ice from the Arctic regions.
The two species named, the common and the
great seal, are very much alike in appearance, and
not easily distinguished by a casual observer; but
a Shetlander who has frequent, if not constant,
opportunities of seeing them, is never at a loss to
recognise them. In many respects, especially in
their habits, they are distinguished by well-marked
characteristics. The common seal is called in
Shetland <i>Tang-fish</i>—that is, shore or bay seal;
and the great seal is vernacularly the <i>Haff-fish</i>,
or ocean seal. The male and female of both
species are distinguished by the prefix ‘Bull’ and
‘She’—<i>Bull-fish</i>, <i>She-fish</i>.</p>

<p>The common seal is gregarious, and appears to
be polygamous. In herds of from ten to a hundred
they frequent the small uninhabited islands,
holms, and skerries, where the tideways are strong,
but the ocean swell not great; and they do not
seem to stray far from such favourite haunts,
resting for several hours each day from the commencement
of the ebb-tide on small outlying
rocks, or stony beaches on the lee-side of the little
islets, but almost always in such a position as to
command a pretty extensive view, in case of surprise.
Their food consists chiefly of piltocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">{365}</span>
and sillocks—vernacular for the young of the
saithe or of the coal-fish—small cod, flounders,
and crustacea. In June, they bring forth their
young, never more than one at a birth, and
in the same season, on the low flat rocks
close to the sea, and immediately lead them to
the water, where they seem at once perfectly
at home, disporting themselves amongst the
waves with ease and grace equal to their seniors.
For some time previous to this, the sexes separate
into different herds; and during the two
succeeding months in which they suckle their
young, the females affect a somewhat solitary life.
After that, they again become indiscriminately
gregarious. The adult common seal sometimes
attains the size of six feet, measured from the
point of the nose to the end of the tail. It is
obviously a mistake to measure to the end of the
hind flippers, as is sometimes done. The males
are considerably larger than the females, but I
have never seen one exceeding six feet.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the haff-fish grows sometimes
to eight or nine feet, and such venerable
ocean patriarchs will weigh from six to seven
hundredweight. This species is much less numerous
than the tang-fish. They appear to be monogamous,
and are not gregarious, being commonly
met with in pairs. They frequent the wildest and
most exposed of the outlying rocks and skerries
along the coast where there is free and immediate
access to the ocean, and are very seldom seen in
the bays or amongst the islands, which are the
haunts of their less robust congeners. They seem
to luxuriate in the roughest sea, and delight to
sport in the broken water and foam at the foot
of steep rocks and precipices when the waves are
dashing against them. They bring forth their
young in caves, open to the sea—called in Shetland
<i>hellyers</i>. These hellyers are natural tunnels in
the lofty precipices, running or winding inwards,
sometimes two hundred yards, into darkness,
and generally terminating in a stony or pebbly
beach. Some of these hellyers can be entered
by a small boat, but only when the sea is perfectly
smooth; others are too narrow for such a mode of
access; and the openings to others are entirely
under water.</p>

<p>It is in these wild and for the most part
safe retreats that the female haff-fish, about
the end of September or beginning of October,
brings forth her young; and here she nurses it
for about six weeks, all the time carefully and
affectionately attended by her lord and master.
Not till the baby haff-fish is nearly two months
old does it take to the water. If thrown
in at an earlier age, it is as awkward as a
pup or kitten in similar circumstances, and does
not seem to have the power of diving. In
these respects, the two species differ markedly.
Nor is the haff-fish so often seen basking on the
rocks; and when he does take a rest on shore,
he does not appear to mind what is the state of
the tide or wind. But probably his usual and
favourite resting and sleeping place is his hellyer,
where he will feel secure from intrusion. His
principal food is cod, ling, saithe, halibut, and
conger-eel. Both species are exceedingly voracious,
but can endure a very long abstinence. A
tame one we once had never tasted food for three
weeks before he died. They always feed in the
water, never on land, tearing large pieces off their
fishy prey, and swallowing it without almost any
mastication. They do not migrate, but remain in
the vicinity of their breeding-places throughout
the year. Formerly, seals’ flesh used to be eaten
by the natives of Shetland, but not now. I have
eaten a part of a seal’s heart, and found it by
no means unpalatable. It was offered to me
as a special delicacy by an old gentleman who
could not have been induced to taste a crab or
lobster. By-the-bye, why is it Shetlanders won’t
eat these delicious crustacea? I once put the
question to an old fisherman, and his reply was:
‘They’re unkirsn—they eat the human,’ meaning
the dead bodies of sailors and fishermen. (Unkirsn
is the vernacular for unclean, in the sense of
being unfit for food.)</p>

<p>I believe seals’ flesh is still sometimes salted
and eaten by the Faroese and Icelanders; but
if one may judge from the very strong coal-tarry
smell of the carcass, it cannot be particularly
savoury. It is different, however, with
whale-flesh, that of the bottlenose at least. Shetlanders
don’t eat it; but the Faroese do, and
esteem it highly. I remember, many years ago,
being in Thorshavn shortly after a shoal of
about twelve hundred bottlenoses had been
driven ashore, and the houses of the little town
were all covered with long festoons of whale-flesh
hung up to dry and harden in the sun. The
natives call it <i>grind</i>, and regard it as excellent,
palatable, and nutritious food. I ate some of
it. It looked and tasted very much like good
coarse-grained beef, and had no unpleasant, fishy,
or blubbery flavour.</p>

<p>Seal-hunting is splendid sport—superior, I confidently
affirm, to every other species of sport
in this country at least, not excepting deer-stalking
and fox-hunting. The game is a noble
animal, large, powerful, exceedingly sagacious,
intensely keen of sight and hearing, suspicious,
shy, and wary. You have to seek him amid the
wildest and grandest scenery, where you will
sometimes encounter danger of various kinds. To
be a successful seal-hunter you must be acquainted
with the habits of the animal. You must be
cool and cautious, yet prompt and fertile in
expedients, a good stalker, a good boatman, and
a good cragsman; and you must be at once a
quick and a steady shot. It is not enough to
strike a seal; you must shoot him with a
bullet through the brain, and thus kill him
instantly, or you will in all probability never
see him again. He may be lying basking on
a rock within forty yards of you; you may put
a bullet through his body; he plunges into the
sea and disappears. But a seal’s head is not a
large object at any considerable distance; and if
he is swimming, you have probably only a part
of his head in view. If you are in a boat, your
stance is more or less unsteady, however smooth
the sea may be. Then, however close he may
be to you, it is needless to fire, if, as is usually
the case, he is looking at you; for he is quite as
expert as most of the diving sea-birds in ‘diving
on the fire,’ or rather throwing his head to a side
with a sudden spring and splash. Further, if you
kill him in the water, the chances are at least
equal that he instantly sinks, fathoms deep,
amongst great rocks covered with seaweed, where
dredging is out of the question; and other
expedients that may be tried, equally, in nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">{366}</span>
cases out of ten, fail. At other times, however,
a seal shot in the water will float like a buoy.
It is not very clear why one seal should float
and another sink. It is certainly not referable
to the condition of the animal. Fat seals sink
as readily as lean ones; and lean seals float as
readily as fat ones. Probably they float or sink
according as their lungs are or are not inflated
with air at the moment they receive their death-wound.</p>

<p>Besides a thoroughly trustworthy weapon, the
seal-hunter requires to provide himself with a
‘waterglass,’ a ‘clam,’ and a stout rod twelve to
twenty feet long, with a ling-hook firmly lashed
to the end of it, making a sort of gaff. These are
for use in the event of a seal sinking. The
waterglass is simply a box or tub with a pane
of glass for its bottom. Placed on the surface
of the water, it obviates the disturbing effect of
the ripple. Looking through it with a great-coat
or piece of cloth thrown over the head
after the manner of photographers, you can see
down as far as sixty feet if the water is pretty
clear; and even to a hundred feet or thereby
if it is very clear. The ‘clam’ is an enormous
species of forceps, with jaws of from two to
three feet width when open. Two stout lines
are attached—one for lowering the clam with
open jaws; the other for closing the blades
over a dead seal that, by help of the waterglass,
has been discovered lying at the bottom,
and hauling him to the surface. Many a seal
is secured in this way, which, but for these simple
appliances, would inevitably be lost. The long-handled
gaff is used for raising a seal that may
have sunk in very shallow water where the rod
can reach him, and sometimes is found very
useful when he is just beginning to sink, if
you have shot him from your boat. For a
few seconds after being shot, he usually floats.
Instantly, you pull up to him, but find him
sinking slowly—only as yet, however, a foot or
two beneath the surface. You at once and easily
gaff him, and then he is safe enough.</p>

<p>The largest haff-fish I ever shot I lost from not
having a seal-gaff in the boat. I was not seal-hunting,
but shooting sea-fowl along the lofty
precipices on the east side of Burrafirth, in the
island of Unst. Suddenly a big haff-fish bobbed
up close to the boat, but instantly disappeared with
a tremendous splash. Seals are very inquisitive
animals; and as he had not had time to gratify
his curiosity, I thought it very likely he might
show face again. We always carried two or three
bullets in our pocket, to be prepared for such
chances. One of these I quickly wrapped round
in paper and rammed home above the shot, with
which my fowling-piece—a long, single-barrelled
American duck-gun—was charged. Again selkie
broke the surface of the water, this time at a
more respectful distance, but still within easy
range. After taking a good look at the boat,
and at me doubtless, who just then covered
him with the sights, he turned fairly round and
gave a contemptuous sniff of his nose skywards,
preparatory to making off. Fatal and unusual
hardihood; it cost him his life, for just then
I pulled the trigger, and sent the bullet through
his head. I was in the bows of the boat. ‘Pull
men, pull hard!’ I shouted. As we came up
to him, I saw he was beginning to sink. A rod
there was in the boat, but it had no hook at the
end. I seized it, and stretching forward, got it
under him, and raised him close to the surface.
I tried to keep him up, but he slipped and slipped
several times, and at last sank. I could have
secured him easily enough, had there been a
hook on the end of the rod. The water was
very deep, and not clear; and although I spent
that evening and the next day searching for him
with the usual appliances, I was unsuccessful. All
these conditions, contingencies, and uncertainties
make the sport of seal-hunting surpassingly
exciting and captivating.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OVER-EDUCATING_CHILDREN">OVER-EDUCATING CHILDREN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A singular</span> question has arisen within the last
few months in reference to the education of young
children in our public and National Schools, and
that is the somewhat startling query: Is not the
present system of ‘cramming’ very young children
not only inexpedient, but dangerous to brain and
life, in trying to force too much ‘book-learning’
into small minds ill fitted for its reception?
Many thoughtful people have of late given much
attention to this interesting question; but the
whole subject has at last been forced upon the
notice of the public in a manner as tragic as it
was unexpected. Two young children have lately
suffered miserable deaths in consequence of overwork,
in other words, over-education. One of
these children, in the delirium of brain-fever,
continually cried out, with every expression of
pain and distress: ‘I can’t do it—I can’t do it!’
alluding, of course, to the difficult sum or long
lesson which had been given her; and so the
poor little overtaxed brain gave way, fever set
in, and death speedily put an end to her
sufferings.</p>

<p>Now this is very sad, and surely need not, and
ought not, to be even possible. To put a higher
and better class of education than was meted out
to our forefathers within the reach of all, is one
of the grandest systems of the present enlightened
age—a system to which no sane person could
possibly object. But even this blessing may be
overdone, through the indiscreet zeal of teachers,
until it becomes a curse, instead of what it
really ought to be, a blessing. The body of man,
acted on by the unerring laws of Nature, plainly
rebels against all overdosing, whether it be in
food, drink, exercise, heat or cold, and clearly
indicates a limit—‘Thus far, and no farther.’ So
it is with the brain. Children are not all constituted
alike, and it is certain that all should
not be treated in the same manner in the training
either of their bodies or their minds. One boy
will develop great muscular strength, and distinguish
himself in athletic games and gymnasium
practice. But will it be pretended because A and
B can do this to their advantage, that C and D,
who do <i>not</i> possess the physical requisites, should
also be compelled to go through the same course?
What must be the consequence? An utter breakdown.
So is it with the mental organisation;
a point which seems to be the last thing that
many teachers take the trouble to study, or even
to think of. All the children who attend the
school—to use a homely but truthful saying—must
be ‘tarred with the same brush,’ no matter
what their capacity or ability. The weak sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">{367}</span>
mind, lacking both ready intelligence and quick
perception, is to be ‘crammed’ and overdosed
with learning for the reception of which it is
unfitted; whilst no allowance is made for want
of ability. And all this in obedience to the
Revised Code of the Education Department, the
principles of which have been denounced as not
seldom producing more evil than good, and serving
only to degrade the higher aims of true education.
The consequences of this system, when it is overdone,
are that the mind gives way, and brain-fever
and death are the painful results. As far
as the public have heard as yet, only two deaths
of children have been recorded as having been
produced by over-pressure of the brain in schools;
but it is not improbable that if two have occurred
in this way, that these are by no means all. It
is also possible that a child may sicken and die
from this overwork without its parents at all
suspecting the real cause.</p>

<p>The question is now fairly before the public;
and a large and influential meeting was held on
the 27th of March last in Exeter Hall, under the
presidency of the Earl of Shaftesbury, ‘to protest
against the existing over-pressure in elementary
schools.’ The most remarkable resolution was
moved by Dr Forbes Winslow, a gentleman who,
from his great professional experience, was well
able to give a fair opinion on a question of brain-work
and brain-pressure. This resolution was to
the effect: ‘That, in the opinion of this meeting,
a serious amount of over-pressure, injurious to the
health and education of the people, exists in the
public elementary schools of the country, and
demands the continued and serious attention of
Her Majesty’s government.’ The resolution then
goes on to condemn the Revised Code, adding, that
‘if the recent changes even alleviate, they will
not remove, this over-pressure.’</p>

<p>Other resolutions passed at this meeting also
referred to the excessive brain-pressure exercised
in schools, and deprecated the Code generally,
especially the inelastic conditions under which
the Education grant is administered, the excessive
demands of the Code itself, and the defects of
inspection. The system of ‘classification’ was
also severely condemned by one speaker, who
added these remarkable words: ‘Ingenious cruelty
could not have provided a more ruinous system
than that of payment by results. All the children
were ground upon the same grindstone, without
reference to their capacity; and accordingly as they
were ground up or ground down to the very same
level, so was the percentage of public money
handed over.’ It was also insisted that teachers
should classify according to ability, and not merely
according to age; a wise and salutary suggestion,
which, if carried out, would undoubtedly save
much useless over brain-work, for it would follow
that, where a child was found to be of a low order
of intellect, cramming and over-pressure would
be futile, and therefore not attempted, as being
simply loss of time. But where children are
placed according to age only in one particular
class, it follows that all constituting that class—dull
or bright—are to be crammed exactly alike,
whether they can bear it or not, and the consequence
must be that whilst the intelligent advance
rapidly, the stupid break down entirely. Such
a system, added to the principle of payment by
results, can be productive of nothing but disaster.</p>

<p>The question has recently been before both
Houses of Parliament; but Mr Stanley Leighton
unfortunately lost his motion by a majority of
forty-nine. His motion was to the effect, that
children under seven should not be presented for
examination—that greater liberty should be given
to teachers to classify according to abilities and
acquirements, and not age only—and that a large
share of the grant should depend on attendance,
and a smaller upon individual examinations.
Mr Leighton concluded by saying that ‘the existing
over-pressure was killing not only children,
but teachers as well.’</p>

<p>As this important subject has at length been
fairly ventilated, it will probably not be allowed
to drop until something has been attempted to
modify and re-arrange much that now exists in
the objectionable Revised Code. Nothing, however,
will accomplish this much-desired result but
agitation and pressure in the right quarters, and
public opinion must make itself both heard and
felt.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="GAS_COOKING-STOVES">GAS COOKING-STOVES.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">BY AN ANALYTICAL CHEMIST.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A short</span> time ago, it was feared that the electric
light would quickly and entirely supersede gas
as an illuminating agent; and whether it eventually
did so or not, there was no doubt that in
the future it would prove a formidable rival.
Those who were most interested in gas, foreseeing
the inevitable change, whilst improving
the positions they occupied so prominently and
so long, sought new fields for the application of
gas, in which they might hold their own, and
probably more than their own, against the conquering
rival. The application of gas to cooking
purposes was one of the results, and, as experience
has since proved, was a very useful and
beneficial one. The writer has had a gas cooking-stove
for some time in his possession, and offers,
therefore, for the benefit of others the results
of personal experience.</p>

<p>The gas-flame used in gas cooking-stoves differs
essentially from the ordinary gas-flame used for
lighting purposes. It is necessary to bear this
in mind, for some persons object to gas-cooking
because they are only acquainted with gas
in the form used for illumination, in which it is
capable of giving off so much soot and other
objectionable products of combustion. In the
gas cooking-flame the combustion is more perfect,
and consequently the temperature is very much
higher, so that by this simple change an extraordinary
saving of gas is effected, while the objectionable
products before mentioned are almost
entirely eliminated. To effect this change, all
that is necessary is to mix the gas with a sufficient
quantity of air before it reaches the flame, and
to subdivide the flame itself. This mixture of
gas and air has been for a long period in use for
heating purposes in the laboratory of the chemist
under the form of the Bunsen burner, and also
in the blowpipe, and is almost indispensable to
him.</p>

<p>The advantages which gas possesses over coal
and peat for cooking purposes may be summed
up as follow: (1) It is always ready, and can
be turned on and off in a moment; (2) It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">{368}</span>
very clean, deposits no soot if properly lighted;
(3) The heat can be regulated to the requirements
of the occasion; (4) It requires no attention;
(5) It is cheap and economical; (6) It
preserves the flavour of meat; and (7) It saves
time and labour.</p>

<p>Any person who considers the amount of
labour and time expended in connection with
ordinary fires—the comparative difficulty of lighting
them—the frequent attention necessary to
maintain them, and the waste of fuel when not in
use—the amount of soot they discharge about the
compartment, and deposit, more particularly in
open stoves, on the utensils used in cooking—the
absence of any means by which the heat
can be properly regulated—cannot fail to be
convinced that coal for cooking purposes has
a great rival in gas. That gas is economical
cannot for a moment be disputed, even when
the question of labour is not included. Of
course the comparison will vary in different
localities; but wherever the price of gas is in
proportion to the price of coal—that is to say,
wherever no exceptionally high price is charged
for the cost of manufacturing gas—the cost
of cooking by the latter will compare favourably
with that of coal. A few figures taken from actual
trial will make this clear. A ton of Wallsend
coals in London costs twenty-six shillings, and
will feed a small kitchen stove for two months;
making the charge thirteen shillings a month.
To this must be added one shilling a month for
firewood, which costs in London three shillings
and sixpence per hundred bundles. This amounts
to fourteen shillings a month. The cost of gas
for doing the same amount of cooking amounts,
at three shillings per thousand cubic feet, to,
say, fourpence a day, or ten shillings a month; to
which eightpence a month for rent of gas-stove
has to be added. This amounts to ten shillings
and eightpence; making the saving per month
upwards of three shillings. Where stoves can be
had for hire from the Gas Companies—and they
can now be had from most Companies—hiring
is cheaper than purchase. Moreover, the Company
keep them in repair without extra cost.</p>

<p>The advantages of gas are felt chiefly in
summer, when coal-fires are not only not required
for heating purposes, but when kept lighted all
day, are positively objectionable; and to the
workers in the kitchen almost intolerable. The
atmosphere of a kitchen where gas is used at this
season contrasts strongly in temperature with
that of one in which coal is burned. When coal-fires
are kept up only for the preparation of each
meal, the cost of relighting is somewhat considerable.</p>

<p>There are many objections offered to the use
of gas for cooking. It is very commonly said
that an offensive smell is imparted to the victuals
cooked by gas—that gas is really more costly in
the end—and that the statements made by gas
and gas-stove manufacturers in respect to working
cost are lower than can be obtained in practice.
If the stove be a good one, the victuals are
generally better cooked than by the ordinary
method; there is no objectionable smell, and
no objectionable taste. The flavour of meat
roasted or baked in a good stove is superior,
because it can be done quickly, and is not
allowed to toughen, as frequently happens before
a low kitchen fire. That gas is not more costly
than coals is proved by the figures given above.</p>

<p>We will conclude by saying a few words about
stoves. It should be seen that means are provided
for supplying a sufficient quantity of air for
admixture with the gas before it reaches the
flame. The air is admitted through a number
of holes or slits opening into the tube through
which the gas passes, and in rushing forward
under pressure the gas draws the air with it
into the flame. To realise a maximum amount
of heat out of a given quantity of gas, it is
necessary to add to it a definite proportion of
air. When the gas rushes rapidly towards the
flame, a greater quantity of air is drawn in
through the orifices provided for that purpose
than when the gas passes more slowly. This to
a certain extent regulates the supply of air; but
it sometimes happens that too much or too little
air is admitted. A small quantity of gas passing
through the pipe cannot exercise the force necessary
to create a partial vacuum into which the
air would be drawn, and as a consequence, the
heat derived from the flame is far below what
might be expected—in short, it ceases wholly or
partially to be a blue flame, and becomes a
luminous and comparatively cold, or perhaps a
smoky one. The other provision is made for
the proper control of the supply of air; and
since an excess is the lesser of the two evils,
it is wiser to adopt the precaution of having
holes or slits in the pipe large enough to
admit a sufficient quantity of air. The larger
the oven or roaster, the more convenient it will
be. This oven should be provided with movable
‘grids’ or trays, and should have one metal
tray for the reflection of heat, by which the
tops of pies, &amp;c., may be browned; and also with
a ventilator, to allow the gases to escape. A
gas-stove with a small oven, or with one divided
into a number of parts without the means of
being enlarged, will be found very inconvenient
if it is required to roast a large joint.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
